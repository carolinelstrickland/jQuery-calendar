For this project, I was asked to create a day planner according to the business day. When the page is first loaded, you will see the current date displayed followed by a log of hours for the business day (9am-5pm). There is a text box within each hour block where the user can input any text information, like a to-do list. There is a save button as well that is linked to localStorage. Through this feature, the input text will persist even after refreshing the page until it is intentionally deleted. 
Additionally, the hour blocks will be color coded according to past, present and future. Past time blocks will become gray, present time blocks will become red and future time blocks will become green. This will automatically update as each hour passes.
